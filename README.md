# US-Bikeshare-Data
# This project is part of a Udacity online course where it is required to make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Code is written to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. A script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal is written to present these statistics.
